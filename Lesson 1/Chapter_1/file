I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to express my interest in the Data Engineer role requiring TS/SCI with polygraph clearance. While my current title is Application Support Analyst, I’ve been delivering full-scale data engineering solutions for over 3 years—building and automating ETL pipelines using Python and SQL in a secure, compliance-driven environment.
